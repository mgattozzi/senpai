# Senpai - A Single Producer Multi Consumer Library

## Should you use this?
Probably not. I mostly made this as a joke and to play around with crossbeam and
atomics. Can you use it though? Yeah knock yourself out.

## Is it on crates.io?
Yeah it is, but like I said, probably shouldn't use it for production code.

## How do I use it?
Check out the test under `src/lib.rs` for an example

## You're not going to support this? That's not very kawaii!
Yeah I know but what do you expect for something made in an hour?

## Will you notice me?
I've always noticed you looking at me and my repo. Don't you worry.
